# Data-Science-Portfolio

Welcome to my Data Science Portfolio 👩🏻‍💻.

This repository showcases a collection of projects that highlight my skills in **data analysis, machine learning, and model evaluation**.  
Each project is documented with a clear business scenario, methodology, results, and actionable insights.
