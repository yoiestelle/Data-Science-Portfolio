# Data-Science-Portfolio

Welcome to my Data Science Portfolio 👩🏻‍💻.

This repository showcases a collection of projects that highlight my skills in **data analysis, machine learning, and model evaluation**.

## 📂 Project Categories  

- **Machine Learning**

[**PJM Hourly Energy Consumption EDA & Forecasting**]
Skills: Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn) · Exploratory Data Analysis · Data Visualization · Time Series Forecasting · Feature Engineering
Analyzed and forecasted electricity demand using PJM hourly energy consumption data (1998–2018). Conducted seasonal and regional demand analysis (summer vs. winter, weekday vs. weekend), engineered lag/rolling features, and built predictive models achieving MAE ~330, RMSE ~450, R² = 0.994. This project demonstrates how forecasting informs grid reliability, demand response, and clean energy planning.

[**Customer Churn Prediction with Logistic Regression**](machine-learning/customer-churn-logistic-regression/Customer%20Churn%20Prediction.ipynb)  
Skills: Python (scikit-learn) · Logistic Regression · Model Evaluation · Feature Tuning
Developed a predictive model for telecom customer churn. Includes feature fine-tuning, coefficient interpretation, and model evaluation using log loss. Demonstrates ability to link predictive modeling to business strategy and customer retention.  

- **SQL**

[**SpaceX Falcon 9 Launch Analysis**](SQL/SpaceX_EDA)
Skills: SQL · Exploratory Data Analysis
Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) on SpaceX Falcon 9 launch records using SQL to assess launch frequency, success rates, and performance metrics.
